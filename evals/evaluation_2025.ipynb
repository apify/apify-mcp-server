        "# MCP Evaluation\n",
        "\n",
        "## Context\n",
        "\n",
        "For the MCP server tool calls evaluation, there are several objectives:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Help to identify problems in the description of the tools\n",
        "2. Create a test suite that can be run manually or automatically in a CI\n",
        "3. Allow for quick iteration on the tool descriptions\n",
        "\n",
        "We considered several options to evaluate the MCP server tool calls.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. ‚úçÔ∏è **Create test cases manually**\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Pros:**\n",
        "  - Straightforward approach\n",
        "  - Simple to create test cases for each tool\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Cons:**\n",
        "  - A bit complicated to create flows (several tool calls in a row)\n",
        "  - Needs to be maintained (every change in the MCP server will require a change in the test cases). But this is true for any other approach.\n",
        "  - Maintenance can be simplified using LLM that collects the data automatically.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. üìä **Collect traces using MCP tester client**\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Pros:**\n",
        "  - Testing exactly in the same way as the end users do\n",
        "  - Collects the data automatically\n",
        "  - Easily scalable to many users\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Cons:**\n",
        "  - It might be impossible to get to a wrong flow of tool calls\n",
        "  - So far, handling complicated flows is not straightforward, and one needs to drag all the data, including tool calls\n",
        "  - It can be done using sessions, similarly to how chatbots are tested, but this brings additional complexity. It might well happen that the evaluator gets confused by the session and will not be able to evaluate the tool calls correctly.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## Create test cases manually\n",
        "\n",
        "Simple example:\n",

        "\"What are the best Instagram scrapers\": \"search-actors\"\n",
        "```\n",

        "## Evaluation\n",
        "\n",
        "Follow the Phoenix evaluation process:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Create the dataset**\n",
        "2. **Define the system prompt and tool definitions**\n",
        "3. **Set up the evaluator**\n",
        "4. **Run the experiment**\n",
        "5. **Iterate and refine**\n",
        "\n",
        "For evaluation, we can either specify ground truth for the tool calls or leverage LLM as a judge. Since we are manually creating test cases, we can directly specify the expected tool calls. However, this does not exclude the possibility of using LLM as a judge at a later stage.\n",

Each of them is built particularly for the relevant scraping case be it videos, comments, or channel data. Feel free to browse them:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n<table>\\\\\\\\n<tr>\\\\\\\\n<td><a href=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"https://apify.com/streamers/youtube-scraper\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\">\\ud83d\\udcf9 YouTube Scraper</a></td>\\\\\\\\n<td>\\ud83c\\udfce\\u00a0<a href=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"https://apify.com/streamers/youtube-channel-scraper\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\">Fast YouTube Channel Scraper</a></td>\\\\\\\\n<td>\\u25b6\\ufe0f <a href=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"https://apify.com/streamers/youtube-shorts-scraper\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\">YouTube Shorts Scraper</a></td>\\\\\\\\n</tr>\\\\\\\\n</table>\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## FAQ\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Is YouTube comments scraping legal?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOur [YouTube scrapers](https://apify.com/store?search=youtube) are ethical and **do not extract any private user data, such as email addresses, gender, or location**. They only extract what the user has chosen to share publicly. However, you should be aware that your **results could contain personal data.** You should not scrape personal data unless you have a legitimate reason to do so.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf you're unsure whether your reason is legitimate, consult your lawyers. You can also read our blog post on the [legality of web scraping](https://blog.apify.com/is-web-scraping-legal/) and [ethical scraping](https://blog.apify.com/what-is-ethical-web-scraping-and-how-do-you-do-it/).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Do I need proxies to scrape YouTube comments?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf you run the scraper on the Apify platform, for successful YouTube scraping you will need\\u00a0[residential proxies](https://apify.com/proxy?pricing=residential-ip#pricing)\\u00a0which are included in Apify's **monthly Starter plan**\\u00a0**($49)**.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor more details about how our pricing works, platform credits, proxies, and usage, see the\\u00a0[platform pricing page](https://apify.com/pricing/actors).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Can I integrate YouTube Comments Scraper with other apps?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLast but not least, YouTube Comments Scraper can be connected with almost any cloud service or web app thanks to integrations on the Apify platform. You can **integrate with LangChain, Make, Trello, Zapier, Slack, Airbyte, GitHub, Google Sheets, Google Drive**, **Asana,** <a  href=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"https://docs.apify.com/integrations\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" target=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"_blank\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\">and more</a>.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou can also use  <a  href=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"https://docs.apify.com/integrations/webhooks\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  target=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"_blank\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\">webhooks</a> to carry out an action whenever an event occurs, e.g., get a notification whenever YouTube Comment Scraper successfully finishes a run.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Can I use YouTube Comments Scraper with the API?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYes. You can do so using Apify API which will enable you to manage, schedule, and run any Apify Actors, including this one. The API also lets you access any datasets, monitor Actor performance, fetch results, create and update versions, and more. To access the API using Node.js, use the `apify-client` NPM package. To access the API using Python for scraping YouTube comments, use the `apify-client` PyPi package.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nCheck out the [Apify API reference](https://docs.apify.com/api/v2) docs for full details or click on the [API tab](https://apify.com/streamers/youtube-comments-scraper/api) for code examples.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### How to use data after web scraping YouTube comments?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe data extracted from YouTube Comment Scraper can be used for a variety of purposes, including:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Sentiment analysis to understand user feedback and reactions.\\\\\\\\n- Tracking trending topics or keywords through comment frequency.\\\\\\\\n- Studying user engagement and interaction with videos or channels.\\\\\\\\n- Incorporating user suggestions to enhance products or content.\\\\\\\\n- Understanding the audience's interests and demographics.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Your feedback\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe\\u2019re always working on improving the performance of our Actors.

They only extract what the user has chosen to share publicly. However, you should be aware that your **results could contain personal data.** You should not scrape personal data unless you have a legitimate reason to do so.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf you're unsure whether your reason is legitimate, consult your lawyers. You can also read our blog post on the [legality of web scraping](https://blog.apify.com/is-web-scraping-legal/) and [ethical scraping](https://blog.apify.com/what-is-ethical-web-scraping-and-how-do-you-do-it/).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Do I need proxies to scrape YouTube comments?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf you run the scraper on the Apify platform, for successful YouTube scraping you will need\\u00a0[residential proxies](https://apify.com/proxy?pricing=residential-ip#pricing)\\u00a0which are included in Apify's **monthly Starter plan**\\u00a0**($49)**.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor more details about how our pricing works, platform credits, proxies, and usage, see the\\u00a0[platform pricing page](https://apify.com/pricing/actors).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Can I integrate YouTube Comments Scraper with other apps?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLast but not least, YouTube Comments Scraper can be connected with almost any cloud service or web app thanks to integrations on the Apify platform. You can **integrate with LangChain, Make, Trello, Zapier, Slack, Airbyte, GitHub, Google Sheets, Google Drive**, **Asana,** <a  href=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"https://docs.apify.com/integrations\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" target=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"_blank\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\">and more</a>.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou can also use  <a  href=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"https://docs.apify.com/integrations/webhooks\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  target=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"_blank\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\">webhooks</a> to carry out an action whenever an event occurs, e.g., get a notification whenever YouTube Comment Scraper successfully finishes a run.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Can I use YouTube Comments Scraper with the API?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYes. You can do so using Apify API which will enable you to manage, schedule, and run any Apify Actors, including this one. The API also lets you access any datasets, monitor Actor performance, fetch results, create and update versions, and more. To access the API using Node.js, use the `apify-client` NPM package.
