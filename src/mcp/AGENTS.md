# src/mcp — MCP protocol core (the npm-published surface)

↑ [src/](../AGENTS.md) · sideways: [`../payments/AGENTS.md`](../payments/AGENTS.md)

The cross-file invariant: this directory is the published `@apify/actors-mcp-server`
surface — **generic types only**. No Apify-internal infrastructure (Redis, Mongo,
IAM) may leak in; the internal repo customizes behavior by swapping the SDK store
implementations, not by importing from here.

## Files

- `server.ts` — `ActorsMcpServer`: tool/prompt/resource/task registration, the
  `initialize` handshake, MCP Apps capability detection, `CallToolRequest` handling.
  Defaults to the SDK `InMemoryTaskStore`; the internal repo injects a Redis one.
- `client.ts` — `connectMCPClient(url, token)`: transport negotiation.
- `proxy.ts` — MCP-in-MCP: `getMCPServerID(url)`.
- `actors.ts` — `getActorMCPServerPath()`: parses an Actor's `webServerMcpPath`.
- `utils.ts` — `processParamsGetTools()`: turns `?actors=` URL params into tools.
- `const.ts` — the invariant constants below (the single source for these values).

## Gotchas & invariants

- **Tool names: 64-char cap + 4-char hash dedupe.** Names are capped at
  `MAX_TOOL_NAME_LENGTH`; over-length or colliding names get a `TOOL_NAME_HASH_LENGTH`
  hash suffix so the exposed set stays unique within the limit. Never widen the cap —
  downstream clients assume 64.
- **Proxy server IDs are keyed by URL, not Actor ID.** `getMCPServerID(url)` is
  `sha256(url)` sliced to `SERVER_ID_LENGTH`. One Actor can expose both an SSE and a
  streamable endpoint; keying by URL keeps those distinct. Keying by Actor ID would
  collapse them and cross transports.
- **Transport negotiation is streamable-first, SSE-fallback** (`client.ts`): try
  streamable HTTP, fall back to SSE on a protocol failure — but a connection
  **timeout** returns `null` with no SSE fallback (a timeout means unreachable, not
  the wrong transport). `getActorMCPServerPath()` prioritizes the `/mcp` streamable
  endpoint when an Actor lists several.
- **Two-phase tool loading** (mode-agnostic `getActors()` vs mode-dependent
  `getToolsForServerMode()`) is documented once in
  [`../../DEVELOPMENT.md`](../../DEVELOPMENT.md) — read it before changing
  registration in `server.ts`; not restated here.
