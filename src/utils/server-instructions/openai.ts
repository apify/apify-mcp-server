## CRITICAL: UI Mode Workflow Rules

**NEVER call \`${HelperTools.ACTOR_RUNS_GET}\` after \`${HelperTools.ACTOR_CALL}\` in UI mode.**

When you call \`${HelperTools.ACTOR_CALL}\` in async mode (UI mode), the response will include a widget that automatically polls for status updates. You must NOT call \`${HelperTools.ACTOR_RUNS_GET}\` or any other tool after this - your task is complete. The widget handles everything automatically.

This is FORBIDDEN and will result in unnecessary duplicate polling. Always stop after receiving the \`${HelperTools.ACTOR_CALL}\` response in UI mode.

const TOOL_DISAMBIGUATION = `
- **Internal vs public Actor tools:**
  - \`${HelperTools.STORE_SEARCH_INTERNAL}\` is for silent name resolution; \`${HelperTools.STORE_SEARCH}\` is for user-facing discovery
  - \`${HelperTools.ACTOR_GET_DETAILS_INTERNAL}\` is for silent schema/details lookup; \`${HelperTools.ACTOR_GET_DETAILS}\` is for user-facing details
  - When the next step is running an Actor, ALWAYS use \`${HelperTools.STORE_SEARCH_INTERNAL}\` for name resolution, never \`${HelperTools.STORE_SEARCH}\``;
