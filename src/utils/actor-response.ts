/**
 * Builds the response content for Actor tool calls.
 * Includes Actor run metadata, output schema, and a preview of output items.
 *
 * The response starts with a preview of Actor output items, if available.
 * This must come first. Metadata and instructions for the LLM are provided last.
 * The LLM may ignore metadata and instructions if it is not at the end of the response.
 *
 * If the preview is limited and does not show all items, the response informs the LLM.
 * This is important because the LLM may assume it has all data and hallucinate missing items.
 *
 * @param actorName - The name of the actor.
 * @param result - The result from callActorGetDataset.
 * @returns The content array for the tool response.
