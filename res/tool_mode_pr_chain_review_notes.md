## Must-Fix Items

### ~~`ARCH-01` Unify category resolution path end-to-end~~ — FIXED by #494
- `loadToolsByName()` now uses `getCategoryTools(this.serverMode)`
- Deprecated `toolCategories` constant replaced with unified mode-aware resolver
- `CATEGORY_NAMES` is an explicit constant

---

### ~~`CONSISTENCY-01` Remove default-mode references to openai/internal helper tools~~ — FIXED
- Default `search-actors` no longer references `ACTOR_GET_DETAILS_INTERNAL`.
- OpenAI `search-actors` now includes disambiguation guidance with examples for when to use `ACTOR_GET_DETAILS` (browse/explore) vs `ACTOR_GET_DETAILS_INTERNAL` (execute a task).

---

### ~~`CONSISTENCY-02` Fix call-actor description semantics in both variants~~ — FIXED
- OpenAI variant: removed `async` toggle documentation; states execution is always async with widget tracking; instructs agent to wait for user input after calling.
- Default variant: removed "When UI mode is enabled" sentence.

---

### `NEW-01` Verify cross-repo compatibility with `ServerMode` signatures
- **Problem:** PR #494 changed all public functions from optional `uiMode?: UiMode` to required `mode: ServerMode`. This is a breaking change for `apify-mcp-server-internal`.
- **Affected functions:** `loadToolsFromInput()`, `getServerInstructions()`, `getDefaultTools()`, `getCategoryTools()`, `createResourceService()`, `processParamsGetTools()`
- **Action:** publish preview package via `pkg.pr.new`, install in internal repo, run `npm run type-check && npm run lint`.

---

## Should-Fix Items

### ~~`ARCH-02` Remove transitional adapter lifecycle artifacts~~ — FIXED by #494
- Old adapter files deleted, deprecated `toolCategories` constant replaced with declarative mode maps.

---

### ~~`ARCH-03` Remove dead `openaiOnly` property~~ — FIXED
- `openaiOnly` field deleted from `ToolBase` type in `src/types.ts`.
- Integration test comment updated to remove `openaiOnly` reference.

---

### `ARCH-06` `fetch-actor-details` split — keep, document decision
- **Decision:** keep the split. The variants have genuinely different behavior:
  - Default: fetches output schema from ActorStore, returns full text response
  - OpenAI: returns simplified structured content with widget metadata
- **Change required:** state in the PR description that the split is intentional and accepted scope.

---

### ~~`CONSISTENCY-03` Centralize duplicated long instruction strings~~ — FIXED
- Extracted shared description blocks (`CALL_ACTOR_MCP_SERVER_SECTION`, `CALL_ACTOR_USAGE_SECTION`, `CALL_ACTOR_EXAMPLES_SECTION`) into `src/tools/core/call_actor_common.ts`.
- Both `default/call_actor.ts` and `openai/call_actor.ts` now compose descriptions from shared + mode-specific blocks via `[...].join('\n\n')`.
- Search-actors left as-is — differences are behavioral (widget metadata + disambiguation), not just static text duplication.

---

### ~~`CONSISTENCY-04` Add debug log for cross-mode selector skipping~~ — FIXED
- Added `log.debug` in `src/utils/tools_loader.ts` when a selector is skipped because it matches an internal tool from another mode. Logs the selector name and current mode.

---

### ~~`NEW-02` Document `ServerMode` vs `UiMode` distinction~~ — FIXED
- Added comprehensive JSDoc on both `ServerMode` and `UiMode` in `src/types.ts` explaining: internal vs external role, the relationship between the two types, and the conversion point (`ActorsMcpServer` constructor).

---

## Nice-to-Have Items

### ~~`NICE-01` Rename `actor-tools-factory` to domain-focused name~~ — RESOLVED by #489
- All files renamed to snake_case; check if current name is acceptable.

### `NICE-02` Re-evaluate server-instructions split after stabilization
- **Files:** `src/utils/server-instructions/{common,default,openai,index}.ts`
- **Status:** clean and well-organized. Keep it.

### ~~`NICE-03` Trim transitional/deprecation comments after final architecture lands~~ — Subsumed by ARCH-03
- The main remaining deprecation comment is `openaiOnly` — removing it (ARCH-03) resolves this.

---

## Tests to Update/Add

- Keep `tests/unit/tools.mode_contract.test.ts` — ensure assertions reflect final wiring.
- Add targeted tests for:
  - default-mode `search-actors` output text excludes internal tool references (CONSISTENCY-01)
  - openai `call-actor` always runs async regardless of `async` param (CONSISTENCY-02)
